          <h5>Discount pricing</h5>A discount is any form of reduction in price
          Discount pricing is where the marketer or retailer offers a reduced
          price. Discounts in a variety of forms - e.g. quantity rebates,
          loyalty rebates, seasonal discounts, periodic or random discounts
          etc.[17] Enormous retailers can request value limits from providers
          and make a rebate evaluating system powerful as they purchase in mass.
          It is normally difficult to rival these retailers dependent on a
          rebate estimating technique. This type of pricing strategy is a
          predominant showcasing procedure to draw in shoppers by providing an
          additional worth or motivator, which urges customers to buy the
          advanced items right away

          <h5>Differential pricing</h5>
          Main article: Differential pricing Differential pricing, also known as
          flexible pricing, multiple pricing or price discrimination , occurs
          where different prices are charged to different customers or
          market-segments, and may be dependent on the service provider's
          assessment of the customer's willingness or ability to pay.[15] There
          are various forms of price difference including: the type of customer,
          the geographic area served, the quantity ordered, delivery time,
          payment terms, etc.

          <h5>Complementary pricing</h5>
          The purchase of a printer leads to a lifetime of purchases of
          replacement parts. In such cases, complementary pricing may be
          considered. Complementary pricing is an umbrella category of
          "captive-market" pricing tactics. It refers to a method in which one
          of two or more complementary products (a deskjet printer, for example)
          is priced to maximize sales volume, while the complementary product
          (printer ink cartridges) are priced at a much higher level in order to
          cover any shortfall sustained by the first product.[12]

          <h5>Exit fees</h5>
          Exit fees are fees charged to customers who depart from the service
          process prior to natural completion or the end of a contract.[20] The
          objective of an exit fee is to deter premature exit.[21] Exit fees are
          often found in financial services, telecommunications services and
          aged care facilities. Regulatory authorities, around the globe, have
          often expressed their discontent with the practice of exit fees as it
          has the potential to be anti-competitive and restricts consumers'
          abilities to switch freely, but the practice has not been proscribed
